## [Pig Game - Live Demo](https://kareemfahmy97.github.io/Pig-Game/)

This website introduce a game called Pig game which considered a simple dice game, where you risk everything to see if you can win more.
You win by being the first player to score 100 or more points.

# So how do you play Pig?
- The first one who plays will be player 1.
-  That player throws a die (Roll Dice Button) and scores as many points as the total shown on the die providing the die doesn‚Äôt roll a 1.
-  The player may continue rolling and accumulating points (but risk rolling a 1) or end his turn.
-  To collect the points in your scores before rolling 1 you can click on (Hold button).
-  Click (New Game button) to start a new round.

# How do you win?
The first player to accumulate 100 or more points wins the game.
